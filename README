README

To-Do:

	1. Content for:
		About
		Contact

		http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11112267/how-can-i-make-the-dropdown-on-boostrap-navigation-to-slide-down-and-up-smoothly?lq=1)

	3. Lightbox gallery needs to be fixed.

	4. 'Downloads' needs to have stuff linked properly, added, and reformatted: Flyers will be images of themselves, which, when clicked, download the pdf. Etc. I'm thinking four items horizontally beside each other.

	5. Mobile menu is a little messy. 
		Might consider option on bottom of this page:  http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_case_navigation.asp 
		http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9405610/how-to-change-navbar-collapse-threshold-using-twitter-bootstrap-responsive

	6. Header? 
		Maybe a catch line? 
		Maybe removing it altogether? 
		Maybe a green gradient? 
		Maybe the logo?
		Project name?
		Jumbotron?

	7. Menu bar colorized?
