README

To-Do:

	K1. Content for:
		About
		Contact

		http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11112267/how-can-i-make-the-dropdown-on-boostrap-navigation-to-slide-down-and-up-smoothly?lq=1)

	K3. Lightbox gallery needs to be fixed.

	K4. 'Downloads' needs to have stuff added, and reformatted: Flyers will be images of themselves, which, when clicked, download the pdf. Etc. I'm thinking four items horizontally beside each other.

	5. Alt index pages/flyer mod: 
		slideshow + black bar + black logo
		dblue flyer + black bar + text

	R6. Header? 
		Maybe a catch line? 
		Maybe the logo - R*uploaded to the site, not sure if it’ll work*
		Project name?
		Jumbotron?

	R7. Menu bar colorized? 
		Completed
		K - Approve or disapprove?
		Meh. Good job, just not my color taste. xD 
		Will leave it to uncle/mom to pick, good to have the option though.

	8. Menu bar centered?

	9. Home page... Slideshow or Flyer?
		R*I’m thinking flyer.*
		K I think the flyer is a better choice too, but we can just leave it for my uncle to decide.
