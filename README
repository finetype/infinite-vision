README

To-Do:

	1. Content for:
		About
		Contact

	2. Details tab needs to be thought out, and javascript 'slidedown' functionality added (see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12115833/adding-a-slide-effect-to-bootstrap-dropdown AND/OR http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11112267/how-can-i-make-the-dropdown-on-boostrap-navigation-to-slide-down-and-up-smoothly?lq=1)

	3. Maybe a Lightbox "powerpoint" implementation of the presentation?

	4. 'Downloads' needs to have stuff linked properly, added, and potentially needs prettier formatting

	5. Mobile menu is a little messy. Might consider option on bottom of this page: http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_case_navigation.asp AND/OR http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9405610/how-to-change-navbar-collapse-threshold-using-twitter-bootstrap-responsive

	6. Header?

	7. Menu bar colorized? http://work.smarchal.com/twbscolor/css/e74c3cc0392becf0f1ffbbbc0

	8. Menu bar centered? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18777235/center-content-in-responsive-bootstrap-navbar
