            <b>Trade Area Info</b>
          </h2>
          <p>
            The Lake Country Town Center site is located at the North West corner
            of Interstate 30 and Highway 271 (the new loop around Mt. Pleasant)
            in the heart of the East Texas I-30 corridor that connects Dallas and
            Texarkana. It is one of the primary shopping, dining and hotel locations
            situated along the 2 1⁄2 hour drive between the two cities.<br /> <br/>
            The site will be an open air shopping center positioned 118 miles from
            Dallas and 63 miles from Texarkana. As the only regional shopping area
            within 30 miles, it offers an incredible secondary market opportunity,
            allowing retailers to have a presence in a market that currently services
            90,000+ residents with a gap leakage of $372,329,100.<br /> <br/>
            Wal-Mart learned the secret of Mt. Pleasant’s prime location for the
            retail trade area decades ago after opening an original Wal-Mart store
            in the 1980’s. Wal-Mart was so successful in this location that they
            chose to open their first Texas Supercenter in Mt. Pleasant; to this day, it
            continues to generate top sales for the state.<br /> <br/>
            Even with Wal-Mart’s great success, the trade area has large spending
            leaks based on Retail Coach’s study that shows regional shoppers are
            driving long distances for these missing product options in mid-size
            cities.<br /> <br/>
            The leaks are being absorbed in trade areas that are 45-90 minutes away
            in Longview, Tyler, and Texarkana. Dallas, 90 minutes away, is the closest
            large city for these regional shoppers to buy at.<br /> <br/>
            Lake Country Town Center will open a venue for other regional and
            national retailers to absorb these retail leaks, while the regional shoppers
            will enjoy the new grocery store, movie theatre and other anchor sites
            planned for the center. The 200 plus seat amphitheatre will host events
            that will bring the city and regional shoppers in to enjoy the ambiance,
            amenities and shopping options that they have long waited to finally be
            conveniently located for them.<br /> <br/>
            Lake Country Town Center is working on Opportunities with potential
            anchors now for the development and will be making them public as
            they are solidified.

            <b>Market Data Summary</b>
          </h2>
          <p>
            The Lake Country Town Center trade area population is 90,000 with an
            average income of $50,000. Retail Coach provided a study of the trade
            area showing potential sales at $717,329,000.<br /> <br/>
            TRMH celebrated 60 years of service this year. With 643 personnel on staff
            they serviced 66,334 patients in 2014. The hospital is located one exit
            down from the Town Center location and is one of the larger immediate
            traffic drivers in the area.<br /> <br/>
            The regional population has been driven to Mt. Pleasant because of
            the traffic flow brought by the Interstate and regional highways that
            provide access to many neighboring small towns. Total traffic counts
            between the access roads for the Town Center are almost 40,000 per
            day. Other major employers in the area are within minutes of the location
            providing a stable daytime population including Mt. Pleasant ISD (3200
            employees) that houses the bulk of their staff at the administration offices
            and high school around the corner from the Lakeside Plaza location.<br /> <br/>
            As time has passed the city has become an attraction because of other
            regional services such as North East Texas Community College (NETCC)
            and Industrial School as well as the Titus Regional Medical Hospital
            (TRMH) that is within minutes of the Lake Country Town Center.
